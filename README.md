### Jupyter notebook analyzing air-sea coupling in the Gulf of Mexico. 
---

The analyses uses output from a **high-resolution (3 km), coupled 8-yr run using ROMS and WRF** for the ocean and atmosphere models, respectively.

The notebook computes lead-lag correlations between: 

(i) the sea-surface temperature (SST) and the turbulent heat flux (latent + sensible) at the ocean surface

(ii) the SST tendency and the turbulent heat flux. 

 

The objective of the analyses is to use the sign and shape of the lead-lag correlation to determine whether the ocean is driving the atmosphere or the other   way round in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The spatial map of the lead-lag correlation in the notebook (final plot) shows the correlations between the fields smoothed to 200 km. It shows at this scale, the spatial pattern is consistent with the atmosphere driving the ocean.
